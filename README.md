## Installation

1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone git@github.com:jimmyzhng/aimagine.git
```

2. Installing Dependencies

There are two folders, backend and frontend. You will have to change into both directories and run "npm install", before you are able to run the application. Here are the steps for installation:

```

cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install

```

3. Create the Environment Variables

This project uses dotenv, so environment variables must be set before the application is functional. To configure these variables, create a .env file in the backend directory.

```
cd backend
touch .env
```
